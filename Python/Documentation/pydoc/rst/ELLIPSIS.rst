The Ellipsis Object
*******************

This object is used by extended slice notation (see *Slicings*).  It
supports no special operations.  There is exactly one ellipsis object,
named ``Ellipsis`` (a built-in name).

It is written as ``Ellipsis``.  When in a subscript, it can also be
written as ``...``, for example ``seq[...]``.
