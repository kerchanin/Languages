Numeric literals
****************

There are four types of numeric literals: plain integers, long
integers, floating point numbers, and imaginary numbers.  There are no
complex literals (complex numbers can be formed by adding a real
number and an imaginary number).

Note that numeric literals do not include a sign; a phrase like ``-1``
is actually an expression composed of the unary operator '``-``' and
the literal ``1``.
